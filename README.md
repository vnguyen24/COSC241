This is the COSC241 - Artificial Intelligence repo. Below is a list of files I wrote and modified, using the UC Berkeley Pacman framework. I am also using this readme file to share with you what I learned in each project, what went right and wrong (mostly wrong), and potentially more.


Project 0:

- Files I edited: addition.py, buyLotsOfFruit.py, shop.py, shopSmart.py

- Project description: The project tackles some of the most common search algorithms (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A*)

- What I learned:
